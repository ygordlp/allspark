About the game:
You need to create a least one Transformer for each team (Autobots / Decepticons): 
- Select a team and The AllSpark will generate a random Transformer with random specs,
    luckily you would get a good one or even and Optimus Prime or a Predaking. This adds a luck
    aspect to the game, just like when you buy game cards in a pack and you don't known what you
    will get.
- If you are not satisfied with the specs of your Transformer you can try you luck again and get 
    new random specs, but team and name can not be changed.
- If you don't like your Transformer at all you can simply delete it.
- After creating a bunch of Transformers, you can make the battle and check the results.
